### What I've learned
- regex in JS.
- Iterators. Defines a sequence. But different than an array because it is not necessarily allocating the entire sequence at once. As long as it implements next() method that returns `value` and `done` properties. Think about a range iterator.

### Future exploration
- `==` vs `===`
- OOP in JS
